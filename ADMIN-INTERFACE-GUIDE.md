# Admin Interface Guide

## Overview

`admin-interface.html` is a standalone admin dashboard for managing users and invitations. It's currently a **local-only** HTML file, but can be deployed.

## üîí Security Model

### How It's Protected

The admin interface uses **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** to protect admin actions:

1. **Authentication Required:** User must be signed in
2. **Admin Check:** RLS policies verify `is_admin = true` in database
3. **Database-Level Security:** Even if someone accesses the file, they can't perform admin actions without proper credentials

### What Admins Can Do

- Create user invitations
- View all users and their roles
- Promote/demote users to/from admin
- See invitation status (used/unused, expired)

### What Non-Admins See

If a non-admin user signs in to the admin interface:
- Can see the UI
- **Cannot** create invitations (RLS blocks it)
- **Cannot** modify user roles (RLS blocks it)
- **Cannot** view other users' data (RLS blocks it)

## üìç Current Status: Local Only

### Why It's Local

The file currently has placeholder Supabase credentials:

```javascript
// Line 261-262 in admin-interface.html
const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'
```

**To use it locally:**

1. Open `admin-interface.html` in a text editor
2. Replace placeholders with your actual values:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://xxxxx.supabase.co'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGc...'  // Your actual anon key
```

3. Open the file in your browser (double-click it)
4. Sign in with your admin account
5. You can now create invitations and manage users!

## üöÄ Option 1: Keep It Local (Recommended for Now)

### Pros
- ‚úÖ Simple - just open the HTML file
- ‚úÖ Secure - not exposed to internet
- ‚úÖ Fast setup - no deployment needed
- ‚úÖ Easy to update credentials

### Cons
- ‚ùå Only accessible from your computer
- ‚ùå Can't share with other admins easily
- ‚ùå Needs Supabase credentials hardcoded in file

### Setup Steps

1. **Copy the file to a secure location:**
   ```bash
   cp admin-interface.html ~/Desktop/radiantcare-admin.html
   ```

2. **Edit the file:**
   ```bash
   # Use your favorite editor
   code ~/Desktop/radiantcare-admin.html  # VS Code
   # OR
   nano ~/Desktop/radiantcare-admin.html  # Terminal editor
   ```

3. **Update credentials (lines 261-262):**
   ```javascript
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://your-project.supabase.co'
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGc...'  // Get from Supabase Dashboard
   ```

4. **Save and open in browser:**
   - Double-click the HTML file
   - OR drag it into your browser
   - Sign in with your admin account

5. **Bookmark it** for easy access!

## üåê Option 2: Deploy It (For Multi-Admin Teams)

If you have multiple admins who need access, you can deploy it.

### Option 2A: Deploy to Vercel (As Static Page)

1. **Create a separate directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p web/public/admin
   cp admin-interface.html web/public/admin/index.html
   ```

2. **Update the file with production credentials**

3. **The file will be accessible at:**
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/admin/
   ```

4. **Pros:**
   - Accessible from anywhere
   - Easy to share with other admins
   - Automatically deployed with your app

5. **Cons:**
   - Supabase credentials visible in page source (but protected by RLS)
   - Anyone can see the interface (but can't use it without admin account)

### Option 2B: Deploy as Protected Route

Better approach - integrate into main app with route protection:

**Future Enhancement:**
- Add `/admin` route to your React app
- Use AuthProvider to check if user is admin
- Redirect non-admins away
- Fully integrated with existing auth system

This is the recommended approach for production but requires more development.

## üîê Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Good Practices

1. **Use RLS:** Already implemented - all admin actions protected by database policies
2. **Keep Admin List Small:** Only make trusted users admins
3. **Use Strong Passwords:** Admin accounts have elevated privileges
4. **Audit Admin Actions:** Check Supabase logs regularly
5. **Rotate Credentials:** If anon key is compromised, rotate it in Supabase

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Know

1. **Anon Key is Semi-Public:** 
   - It's called "anon" key because it's meant to be in client-side code
   - Real security comes from RLS policies, not hiding the key
   - Service Role Key should NEVER be in frontend code (and it's not!)

2. **Anyone Can View HTML Source:**
   - If deployed, anyone can see your Supabase URL and anon key
   - This is **OK** because RLS protects all operations
   - Non-admins can't perform admin actions even with these credentials

3. **Physical Access = Full Access:**
   - If someone has access to your computer and the local HTML file
   - And they know your admin password
   - They can perform admin actions
   - Solution: Keep your computer secure and use strong passwords

   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Sign in failed" or "Invalid credentials"

**Causes:**
- Using non-admin account
- Incorrect Supabase credentials in HTML file
- User account not confirmed

**Solutions:**
- Verify you're using admin account email/password
- Check Supabase credentials match your project
- Ensure `is_admin = true` in database for your user

### Issue: "Failed to create invitation" error

**Causes:**
- Not signed in
- Not admin user
- Network error

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check browser console (F12) for specific error
- Verify `is_admin = true` in profiles table
- Check Supabase is accessible (not down)

### Issue: Invitation code not working for user

**Causes:**
- Code expired
- Code already used
- Email doesn't match

**Solutions:**
- Check invitation status in admin interface
- Create new invitation if expired/used
- Ensure user enters EXACT email used in invitation
- Code is case-sensitive

### Issue: Can't see other users in User Management

**Causes:**
- Not admin
- RLS policy blocking access

**Solutions:**
- Verify `is_admin = true` in database
- Sign out and sign back in
- Check Supabase RLS policies are enabled
